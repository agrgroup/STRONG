## Contents
This repository contains the necessary MATLAB/Python scripts for the following tasks:

## Generating STRONGs for an XYZ file
Input- xyz files (XYZ_to_STRONG/xyz_file/*.xyz) <br>
Output- STRONGS (XYZ_to_STRONG/text_files/STRONGS.txt)

All the xyz files need to be kept in the xyz_file folder in the XYZ_to_STRONG sub-directory. main.m (XYZ_to_STRONG/matlab_files/main.m) MATLAB script is used to convert XYZ files present in the directory "XYZ_to_STRONG/xyz_file" to STRONGs. Output is strored in the txt format present in "XYZ_to_STRONG/text_files" directory.
Note that, the complete dataset generated for N=4 to N=22 using the kMC code developed by Sheshnarayan and GovindRajan () can be found at .
