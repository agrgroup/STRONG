## Contents
This repository contains the necessary MATLAB/Python scripts for storing, manipulating, and comparing nanopores in graphene using a new language framework called STring Representations of Nanopore Geometry (STRONGs). These scripts enable the following tasks:

## Generating the STRONG for an XYZ file
Input: XYZ files (XYZ_to_STRONG/xyz_file/*.xyz) <br>
Output: STRONGs (XYZ_to_STRONG/text_files/STRONGS.txt)

All the XYZ files must be kept in the xyz_file folder in the XYZ_to_STRONG sub-directory. The main.m (XYZ_to_STRONG/matlab_files/main.m) MATLAB script genrates the STRONGs corresponding to the XYZ files in the directory "XYZ_to_STRONG/xyz_file". The output is written in TXT format in the "XYZ_to_STRONG/text_files" directory. We have provided an example set of 100 XYZ files in the "XYZ_to_STRONG/xyz_file" directory. 
Note that the unique dataset of nanopores (# of unique nanopores = 20812) generated by removing N=4 to N=22 atoms from the lattice of graphene nanopores using the KMC code developed by Sheshanarayana and Govind Rajan used to generate the dataset for formation time and energy can be accessed at - https://indianinstituteofscience.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/STRONGs/Elg3sKBIpMdBrv6zkqCvB0EB-_hIJOCYz-1JZ9wYTDqwyg?e=gJcgB8. The XYZ files of stable nanopores (# of stable nanopores = 24884) used to generate the dataset for gas permeation barrier can be accessed at - https://indianinstituteofscience.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/STRONGs/EhVcZxiEvolFoDKWNOPNTewBM2HsFZm3-RmGGCPaBytQHg?e=BiCOq1.  

## Comparing Nanopores
Input: xyz files (Comparing_Nanopores/xyz_file/*.xyz) <br>
Output: Unique STRONGs (Comparing_Nanopores/text_files/unique_pore_subset.txt)

The XYZ files to be compared are kept in the xyz_file folder in the Comparing_Nanopores sub-directory. The main.m (Comparing_Nanopores/matlab_files/main.m) MATLAB script is used to compare nanopores (xyz files) present in the directory "Comparing_Nanopores/xyz_file". The information regarding the unique number of XYZ files is stored in the TXT format in the "Comparing_Nanopores/text_files" directory. For example, there are 50 xyz files (or nanopore structures) in the xyz_file directory. There are three unique nanopore structures (1, 10, and 14) shown in the unique_pore_subset.txt. Any other structure is either a rotatioanl or reflectional image of these unique structures. 
Note that the graphene nanopores (# of nanopores for each N = 10000) generated using the KMC code (developed by Sheshanarayana and Govind Rajan) by removing N=4 to N=22 atoms from the lattice of graphene nanopores can be accessed at - 

## Converting STRONGs to Canonical STRONGs
Input: STRONGs (STRONG_to_Canonical_STRONG/STRONGS.txt) <br>
Output: Canonical STRONGs (STRONG_to_Canonical_STRONG/canonical_strongs.txt)

The STRONGs are converted to canonical STRONGs, used as a feature in the machine learning (ML) model using the main.m (STRONG_to_Canonical_STRONG/main.m) MATLAB script. The STRONGs to be canonicalized are kept as a text file in the STRONG_to_Canonical_STRONG directory. Canonicalized STRONGs i.e., an output of the MATLAB script, is present as a text file in STRONG_to_Canonical_STRONG directory. 

## Machine Learning for Structure-Property Relationships
Input: CSV files (Machine_Learning/input/*.csv) <br>
Output: Parity plots (Machine_Learning/figures/formation_time/parity_plot.png, Machine_Learning/figures/formation_energy/parity_plot.png, Machine_Learning/figures/CO2_barrier_1/parity_plot.png)

Jupyter notebooks for formation time (Machine_Learning/ft_canonical_STRONGs.ipynb), formation energy (Machine_Learning/fe_canonical_STRONGs.ipynb), and CO2 gas permeation barrier (Machine_Learning/barrier_CO2_canonical_STRONGs_radius_feature_1.ipynb) are run to obtain the ML performance matrix and the parity plot present in the figures sub-directory for each structure-property.  

## Enumerating Stable Nanopores
Input: "N" number of atoms to be removed from the graphene nanopore lattice (STRONG_Enumeration/stable_nanopores.m) <br>
Output: enumerated STRONGs and time of enumeration (STRONG_Enumeration/enumerated_strongs.txt, STRONG_Enumeration/enumerated_strongs_time.txt)

The user needs to input "N", i.e., the number of atoms removed from the graphene lattice in the stable_nanopores.m (STRONG_Enumeration/stable_nanopores.m) MATLAB script before executing the script file. The enumerated STRONGs are stored in the enumerated_strongs.txt file, and the time of enumeration is stored in enumerated_strongs_time.txt file. 

## Converting STRONGs to XYZ
Input: STRONGs (STRONG_to_XYZ/strongs.txt) <br>
Output: XYZ files (STRONG_to_XYZ/*.xyz)

The STRONGs to be converted to XYZ files are stored in a text file (STRONG_to_XYZ/strongs.txt). The strong_to_xyz.m (STRONG_to_XYZ/strong_to_xyz.m) MATLAB script can be run to generate all the XYZ files corresponding to each STRONG. 

## XYZ to functionalized STRONG
Input: XYZ file (XYZ_to_FunctionalizedXYZ/pore_xyz_file/*.xyz) <br>
Output: XYZ files (STRONG_to_XYZ/functional_xyz/*.xyz)

An input XYZ file for which all the possible functionalized XYZ files are to be generated is placed in the pore_xyz_file sub-directory (XYZ_to_FunctionalizedXYZ/pore_xyz_file/*.xyz). The main.m (XYZ_to_FunctionalizedXYZ/matlab_files/main.m) MATLAB script is executed to generate all the functionalized XYZ files stored in the functional_xyz (XYZ_to_FunctionalizedXYZ/functional_xyz) sub-directory generated after the execution of the MATLAB script.
